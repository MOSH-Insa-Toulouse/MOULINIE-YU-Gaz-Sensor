# Connected gas sensor / LoRa TTN
Project 5th ISS - MOSH - TP Gas Sensor
Authors: MOULINIÃ‰ Dorian & YU Juan from INSA Toulouse - 5 ISS

# Description

This main goal of this project is to build a connected nanoparticle gas sensor to monitor the concentration of gas.

For this, we used an Arduino UNO and RN2483 LoRa chip to send data on the The Things Network.

KiCad PCB Files: A shield for the gas sensor and the LoRa Module to plug in an Arduino Uno

## Overview

This shield is composed of:

 - a LoRa Module (RN2483) as transceiver
 - a Gas sensor
 - an amplifier (LTC1050)
 - a Groove connector for future calibration of the Gas Sensor

First, we created the project with an anduino UNO
Then, we created a library symbole for LTC 1050
Afterwards, we created the following circuit :
